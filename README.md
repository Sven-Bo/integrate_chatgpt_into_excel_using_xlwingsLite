- Run Python code inside Excel—even if Python isn't installed
- Use scripts to send data to OpenAI and insert results into new sheets
- Supports dynamic prompts and ranges for flexible use cases



## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Open Excel and go to the **Home** tab → click on **Add-ins**
2. Search for **xlwings lite** and click **Add**
3. In the task pane, paste the provided Python code
4. Get your OpenAI API key from [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
5. Paste the API key into the designated input field in Excel
6. Use the formulas:
   - `=askai(prompt, range)` for a single result
   - `=askai_list(prompt, range)` for multi-row or multi-column outputs



## 📦 Extras

I've also included a script that sends Excel data to OpenAI and inserts the result into a new sheet.  
You can tweak the prompt, code, or input however you like.
